In this project, I use a technique called web scraping to gather information from a well-known website called AmbitionBox. By doing this, I'am able to collect data on more than 10,000 companies. This data can be useful for various purposes like market research, job hunting, or analyzing industry trends.

Requirements: numpy, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup
